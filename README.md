# ARB-Detector

Due to the lack of regulation on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), arbitrageurs can leverage information and price differentials to profit on platforms such as Ethereum blockchain. DEX arbitrage brings the possibility and opportunity of fraud, and may seriously damage the operation of the Ethereum ecosystem. It prompts this work to explore and characterize the unique characteristics of arbitrage, which differs from other frauds such as money laundering and Ponzi games, for better detection.
