# ARB
Source code of our JSAC 2022 paper "Detecting Arbitrage on Ethereum Through Feature Fusion and Positive-Unlabeled Learning"

Due to the lack of supervision in the decentralized exchanges (DEXs), arbitrageurs can utilize information and take advantage of price gap to make profits over such platforms such as Ethereum blockchain. DEX arbitrage poses possibilities and opportunities for defrauding and can seriously impair the operation of the Ethereum ecosystem. It motivates this work to explore and characterize the unique features of arbitrage which differ from other frauds such as money laundering and Ponzi games for better detection. This work makes the first attempt for detecting arbitrage on Ethereum through feature fusion and positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning).
